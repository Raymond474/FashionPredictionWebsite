# FashionPredictionWebsite
I created a Keras model for predicting fashion. Using this model, I put it on a flask web app to simplify the process so anyone can use the model for themselves. I also added inverse thresholding to preprocess the images uploaded by users. Note: the model was trained using the fashion-minst dataset.
